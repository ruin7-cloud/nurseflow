# 🩺 NurseFlow: AI-Powered Clinical Handover Assistant

**NurseFlow Pro** is a next-generation clinical decision support system designed to streamline nursing documentation, calculate risk scores accurately, and enhance patient safety using Generative AI.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Hybrid AI Architecture:** Combines Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite with a Python-based logic engine to calculate **NEWS2 (National Early Warning Score)** mathematically, eliminating the risk of AI hallucinations in critical calculations.
* **Multimodal Data Intake:**
    * **📸 OCR Vision:** Instantly reads vital signs from patient monitor screens or handwritten notes.
    * **🎙️ Voice-to-Data:** Transcribes voice notes and automatically extracts structured clinical data (JSON).
    * **⌨️ Text Parsing:** Converts unstructured clinical notes into structured formats.
* **Automated Documentation:** Generates professional, GDPR-compliant **ISBAR (Identify, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation)** handover reports in PDF format.
* **Privacy First:** Includes a dedicated "Privacy Mode" to anonymize patient data for security.
